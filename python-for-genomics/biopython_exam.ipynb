    "(3) In molecular biology, a reading frame is a way of dividing the DNA sequence of nucleotides into a set of consecutive, non-overlapping triplets (or codons). Depending on where we start, there are six possible reading frames: three in the forward (5' to 3') direction and three in the reverse (3' to 5'). For instance, the three possible forward reading frames for the sequence AGGTGACACCGCAAGCCTTATATTAGC are: \n",

What is the identifier of the sequence containing the longest ORF? For a given sequence identifier, what is the longest ORF contained in the sequence represented by that identifier? What is the starting position of the longest ORF in the sequence that contains it? The position should indicate the character number in the sequence.

    "4) A repeat is a substring of a DNA sequence that occurs in multiple copies (more than one) somewhere in the sequence. Although repeats can occur on both the forward and reverse strands of the DNA sequence, we will only consider repeats on the forward strand here. Also we will allow repeats to overlap themselves. For example, the sequence ACACA contains two copies of the sequence ACA - once at position 1 (index 0 in Python), and once at position 3. Given a length n, your program should be able to identify all repeats of length n in all sequences in the FASTA file. Your program should also determine how many times each repeat occurs in the file, and which is the most frequent repeat of a given length.\n"
