## Introduction

This repository showcases my work and projects from the Python for Genomic Data Science course. The course is offered by Johns Hopkins University as part of the Genomic Big Data Science Specialization.

In this course, I learned the fundamentals of the Python programming language and its applications in genomic data analysis. The course covered topics such as working with DNA sequences, computing GC percentage, identifying stop codons, and more.

By completing this course, I gained valuable skills in Python programming and its application to genomic data analysis, which will be beneficial in my career as a bioinformatician.

## Course Content

- Week One: Introduction to Python and iPython notebook
- Week Two: Functions and modules in Python
- Week Three: Loops and control structures
- Week Four: File input/output and data visualization

Throughout the course, I completed various assignments and projects that allowed me to apply the concepts learned in each week's module.

## Final Project

- **Description**: This assignment involves analyzing DNA sequences to find open reading frames (ORFs) and identify the most frequent repeats.
- **Files**:
  - `main.py`: Main script for running the analysis.
  - `fasta_utils.py`: Utility functions for reading FASTA files and analyzing sequences.
  - `README.md`: This file.
